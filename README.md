This repository contains scripts for the analysis done in Chapter 5, _Challenges in spatial cell-cell communication via the NicheNet framework_, of my dissertation.

- `scripts/vizgen` contains the neighborhood enrichment and niche detection analyses on the mouse liver Vizgen dataset (Figures 5.3 and 5.4)
- There are also scripts for other datasets (Moleculary Cartography by Resolve Biosciences, Nanostring CosMx), but this was not mentioned in the chapter
